  "body": "# Fast Image Annotation Tool (FIAT)\r\n\r\n## Abstract\r\n\r\nFIAT is a simple tool build for image data annotation using rectangles. It is based on OpenCV high GUI. The User can select rectangular regions of interests whilst assigning class names to each object.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n- Boost Library: - program_options\r\n                 - filesystem\r\n- OpenCV Library: - imgproc\r\n                  - core\r\n                  - highgui\r\n                  - imgcodecs\r\n\r\n## Folder architecture\r\n\r\nThe folder hierarchy should resemble that of the PASCAL challenge: i.e.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndata/\r\n    |-- Annotations/\r\n         |-- *.txt (Annotation files)\r\n    |-- Images/\r\n         |-- *.png (Image files)\r\n    |-- ImageSets/\r\n         |-- train.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor each image in `data/Images/foo.png`should correspond an annotation file `data/Annotations/foo.txt` containing objects' coordinates and their classes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbar <x1> <x2> <y1> <y2>LF\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Building\r\n\r\nYou can build the project on Unix/Mac systems using the Makefile. You should however make sure Boost and OpenCV directories  in lines #15 to #20 are the right ones.\r\n\r\nOn Windows, you can use Cmake to generate the project - on Visual Studio for instance - and build it.\r\n\r\n## Tutorial",
