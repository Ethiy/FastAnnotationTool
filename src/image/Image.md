#Image documentation

This is a wrapper of the openCV Mat class representing images. The goal is to store all relevant information to be available almost instantly.

Thus we can preprocess images at the very moment we read them.

Due to the later use, we also need to resize images to have a 224px minimum for both dimensions if need be.
